# /assets
This folder contains all assets used by our bot. Right now, we have a folder full of canned responses that the bot can send for a variety of scenarios in `templates/`, some `container/` assets, and some `demo/` images used in the repo.

*Why not put these canned template responses in code?* Good question. I think that these response could be customized depending on the deployment. With that in mind, should the user have to re-compile the bot to change the responses? I think not. It only adds minor complexity to the bot program.
